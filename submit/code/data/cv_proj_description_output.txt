Final Project
ComputerVision, EN. 600.461/661
ProfessorAustin Reiter
Fall 2016

This course will have a final project component to it. The best wayto learn computervision isto do
computervision. Solet’s dojustthat! '

Overview:

The final projectwill makeup 35% of your final grade, and will consist of: a project proposal write-up
(due: 10/20/16), an in-class poster presentation (will take place during final class period on 12/08/16,

moo-1:15 pm),anda final report(due:on 12/08/16 - NQ EXCEPWQNSE)

You may work in teams, up to 4 people (no more than 4 people unless otherwise approved by me), and
ifyou’d ratherwork alone that’s allowed. Your project is designed to be Open-ended, but it must be

I approved by me and the TAs in the project proposal stage. lfyou are working in a team, l have higher
expectations that those who choose to work alone! Please come talk to me ifyou're unsure ifyour
projectis acceptable. ldon'twant itto be too easy, and l don’twantit to be too hard. The pointis to
get some good hands-on computervision experiencewith an actual project using the concepts we learn

throughoutthe semester. Students in 461 and 661 can work as a team but 661 projects will have higher
expectations. /

Programming Language:

You may use any programming language you want here (e.g., MATLAB, C, C++, Java, Python etc). You
may also use the Image ProcessingToolbox provided by MATLAB as well openly availabletoolkits on the

web. I will suggest OpenCV as a great toolbox as well as Point Clouds Library (PCL) ifyou are dealing
with 30 data.
