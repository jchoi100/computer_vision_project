1. Topic: Optical document recognition

3%. Motivation: Dynamics in college classrooms have changed drastically in the past decade. Just
about ten years ago, rarely did students open their laptops in lecture to take notes—rarely did
.professors allow students to open their computers in class. These days, most students take notes
using their laptops. Reasons range from the fact that many students these days have bad
penmanship, they are used to typing on their computers, or electronic archives are easier to refer to
in the future. However, some students still take notes using pen and paper. Personally, i take the
traditional approach in the classroom so that I can easily draw figures presented in class, get less
distracted on my computer, and just to have fun using my new ink pen. Nevertheless, it is true that
sometimes, I wish I had taken notes using my computer. Can’t l have the cake and eat it too?

4. Details: I will implement a program that can do mainly two things: 1) Input a photo of a document,
convert it into a scanned version; 2) Input a scanned document (whether it be the output of this
program or a scan from a photocopier), output a text or word document with the contents of the
document typed out. Optionally: 1) recognize figures and drawings and save them separately; 2)
translate document into different languages using existing APls (e.g. Google Translate); 3) return
searchengine results for ”important” terms that appear in the document as a list of web links.

5. Programming Language: Python or MATLAB

6. Tools: OpenCV, Google Translate APl, etc.

7. Challenges: In many cases, handwritten notes have diagrams and figures that are not characters
easily translatable into their electronic representations. Moreover, hand-scanned or photographed
documents may have artifacts, noise, and features we are not interested in (e.g. table, hand, coffee
mug, etc). Furthermore, amongst all such noise, the document we are interested in may not be in
perfect angles—we might need to apply affine transformations and/or solve for homographies.

8. Existing Applications:

- Scanner Pro (iPhone app): allows scanning of documents; corrects distortion and geometry;
supports Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.; recognizes 21 different languages.

i$canner (iPhone app): converts photos into scanned versions; removes noise and corrects
distortion and geometry.
