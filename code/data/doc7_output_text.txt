This course will have a final project component to‘it; iThe'best wayto learn co’mputerVision isto do'
computervision.Solet’sdojustthat! ‘ ' ' '

Overview: .

The final projectwill makeup 35% of yourfinal grade,‘and willrconsist of: a project proposal write-up
(due: 10/20/16), an in-class poster presentationlwill take place during final class period on 12/08/16, . ‘

moo-1:15 pm); and a final report (dUezon 12/08/16 ~ N0 EXCEPWQNS 3)

You may‘work in teams, up to 4 people (no more thanv4 people unless otherwise approved by me), and
. ifyou' d ratherwork alone that’s allowed Your project IS designed to be open- -,ended but it must be
approved by me and the TAs In the project proposal stage. Ifyou are working In a team, I have higher

expectations that those who choose to work alone! Please come talk to me ifyou’ re unsure ifyour
projectis acceptable. ldon’twant itto be too easy, and l don’twantit to be too hard. The pointis to

get some good hands-on computervision experiencewith’an actual project using the concepts we learn
throughoutthe semester. Students in 461 and 661 can work as a team but 661 projects will have higher
expectations. / ‘ ’ '

Programming‘Language:

You may use any programminglanguage you want here (e. g., MATLAB, C, CH, Jaya, Python etc), You
may also use the Image ProcessingToolbox provided by MATLAB as well openly availabletoolkits on the

web. I WIll suggest OpenCV as a great toolbox as well as Pomt Clouds Library (PCL) ifyou are dealing
with 3D data. "
